WELCOME_MESSAGE = "Welcome to the Well Production Forecasting Dashboard — " \
"your smart companion for data-driven petroleum engineering."

PLATFORM_DESCRIPTION = "This platform leverages advanced machine learning techniques " \
"to predict oil and gas production rates with high accuracy."

UPLOAD_INSTRUCTION = "Users can upload their own well datasets, allowing the system to " \
"train custom models tailored to their field conditions and generate " \
"precise, scenario-specific forecasts."

WORKFLOW_SUPPORT_MESSAGE = "Whether you're optimizing field development, monitoring reservoir " \
"performance, or planning future operations, this dashboard provides " \
"actionable insights, intuitive visualizations, and AI-powered predictions " \
"designed for real-world petroleum engineering workflows."


UPLOAD_DATASET_INFO = "You can select from the default datasets included in the project, " \
"or upload your own custom datasets to use with the models."

NAME_NATURAL_GAS_PRODUCTION = "North Dakota Natural Gas Production"

NAME_CUMULATIVE_OIL_PRODUCTION_2020 = "North Dakota Cumulative Oil Production by Formation Through 2020"

NAME_MONTHLY_OIL_PRODUCTION_BY_COUNTY = "North Dakota Historical Monthly Oil Production by County"

NAME_MCF_GAS_PRODUCTION_BY_COUNTY = "North Dakota Historical MCF Gas Produced by County"

DESC_NATURAL_GAS_PRODUCTION = "This dataset comes from North Dakota and contains real-world data. " \
"It includes monthly values for gas produced, sold, and flared, along with additional measurements " \
"specific to the Bakken formation. Because the data reflects actual field-level reporting, " \
"it is suitable for analytics, forecasting, and operational studies."

DESC_CUMULATIVE_OIL_PRODUCTION_2020 = "This dataset presents cumulative oil production in North Dakota by geological " \
"formation through December 2020. Each row represents a specific formation, reporting " \
"the total oil produced (in barrels), the percentage contribution of that formation to " \
"the overall production, and the number of wells associated with it. The dataset covers " \
"major formations such as Bakken, Three Forks, Madison, Red River, and others, along with " \
"minor formations, providing a comprehensive overview of North Dakota's oil production landscape. " \
"It is structured to facilitate comparative analysis across formations, evaluation of contributions, " \
"and assessment of well counts relative to output over time."

DESC_MONTHLY_OIL_PRODUCTION_BY_COUNTY = "This dataset provides historical monthly oil production in North Dakota broken down by county, " \
"spanning April 1951 to August 2025. Each row is one month, each column one county, reporting " \
"barrels produced. Counties include Adams, Billings, Bottineau, Bowman, Burke, Divide, Dunn, " \
"Golden Valley, Hettinger, McHenry, McKenzie, McLean, Mercer, Mountrail, Renville, Slope, Stark, " \
"Ward, and Williams. Useful for long-term trends, comparisons and production analytics."

DESC_MCF_GAS_PRODUCTION_BY_COUNTY = "This dataset provides monthly numerical values for North Dakota counties from January 1990 to August 2025. " \
"Each row represents a month, each column a county — including Adams, Billings, Bottineau, Bowman, Burke, " \
"Divide, Dunn, Golden Valley, Hettinger, McHenry, McKenzie, McLean, Mercer, Mountrail, Renville, Slope, Stark, " \
"Ward, and Williams. It supports temporal analysis, regional comparison, and trend forecasting."
